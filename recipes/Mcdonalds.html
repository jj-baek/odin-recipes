    <img src = "recipe_images/nikocado_mcdonalds.jpeg" width = "600" height = "400">
    <h3>The pinnacle of American cuisine, only for the most sophisticated palates</h3>
    <p> Go to Mcdonalds. I'm not asking. <br> They are cheap, delicious, 
        and you will most likely feel terrible afterwards. Use the app for up to 50% off deals!
        <br> <strong>THIS IS NOT A RECIPE (I can't cook)</strong>
    </p>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ajs1frIdcY" target = "_blank">Pink slime</a> (for legal reasons this is a joke) </li>
        <li>Way too much sodium, saturated fat, sugar</li>
        <li>Happiness (where the "happy" in happy meals comes from)</li>
        <li>Sadness (self-explanatory)</li>
        <li>Who cares stop reading</li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to the McDonald's drive thru </li>
        <li>Wait too long next to drive thru box. Just as your patience runs out, they take your order</li>
        <li>Order what you want. Oh the ice cream machine is broken? <em>Fuck</em> me then I guess</li>
        <li>Pay for your order</li>
        <li>You definitely got the wrong order. It still tastes good though</li>
