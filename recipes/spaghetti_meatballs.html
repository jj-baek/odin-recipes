    <h3>A delicious meal for those who somehow manage to burn water</h3>
    <p>This recipe is quite simple. All you need is a bag of costco 
        microwavable meatballs and whatever boxed spaghetti noodles and jar sauce. <br> 
        Boil the noodles, microwave the meatballs, combine everything
        with the sauce, voila bitch bon ape tits you have the meal that 
        I eat to stave off the feeling of impending doom. <br> Is it healthy, no. Is it a gourmet
        fucking meal, no. Is it cheap, fast, and easy while tasting pretty 
        decent? Yeah, so shut the fuck up (jk).
